        <p class="yellow">Sofie and Julie were given the task to find and buy a 2-dollar-object they thought was worth much more.</p>

        <h3>Sofie</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I chose an octopus coathook, the size of the palm of my hand, sort of. Maybe a bit smaller actually. It’s slightly heavy, made of some kind of.. iron.. It’s a beautiful sky-blue colour. It has two hooks, sort of two octopus arms <span class="emoji">🐙</span>, and two crooked eyes.</p>
        <br>

        <img src="assets/images/sofie-screen-shot.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I chose this because I’ve just moved apartments, and I could use a coathook. Then I saw it, and I thought it was both cute and also a little special. Not just a hook for a jumper, but it’s got something extra by being kind of quirky.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And it was so cheap too! I’ve seen a few designer homewares with similar octopus-hooks. But this one is a pretty good alternative.</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Julie] It’s funny because the eyes are crooked, and not like the ones where the screws sit parallel. It’s a bit cross-eyed… or a little confused.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yes, actually really <em>octopus-like</em>. That’s pretty cool I think.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Things I considered:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I also had a look at some strawberry-flavoured straws, which were pretty cool. Quite unique. They’d be spot on for a pink birthday party! <span class="emoji">💘</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>[Julie] Like a theme party?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yes! I love them.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Then I considered some clear bags, like ziplock ones. They are just so versatile and can be used for heaps of things. Maybe more practical than strawberry-flavoured straws… They’re great when travelling too – for lotions and such.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I also saw a really pretty mortar and pestle. And it’s because I think that a mortar is such a lovely kitchen thing, but then, at the same time, one that you never use. But it looks great, and if someone has one in their kitchen, then I always get the impression that they cook great food, haha.</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Julie] So you’d like to give that impression, haha?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yes, I’d love that <span class="emoji">🤣</span></p></p>

        <p>The object I chose is a hair piece. It’s brown.. [guided by Sofie] a sort of amber-brown. It has a spring to make it open and grab your hair, a hair clip I guess. It’s made of plastic, and is, maybe, a little smaller than a palm. It has six 'teeth' that sort of clutched a piece of cardboard as it’s packaging… if you can call it that…</p>

        <img src="assets/images/Julie-screen-shot.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I think the reason that I chose this is that it’s something I can use every day. And I also thought, that maybe, it sort of matches my hair colour. It’s slightly lighter, but I can picture it. It has a bit of sheen and a few different shades somehow.</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Sofie] It’s also a bit fashionable at the moment to use a hair clip?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yes, you’re right. This one is really cheap though, compared to those popular $20 ones! Yeah, so I think it’s a steal for an object, that I <em>know</em> I will use. It’s cheapness almost makes it more special. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I’m really happy with my hair clip.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Things I considered:</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>A beer pong set – because everyone knows how that's a <em>must-have</em> <span class="emoji">🍻🏓</span>! But, then I thought I might not use it much.. Maybe it's something you’d buy when you need it. But I do like beer, and I’m actually <em>pretty</em> good at beer pong, so I thought it was an OK option.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Next I had a look at some marzipan candy – which I love! But I wasn’t really in a candy-mood, and maybe it's also more of a Christmas-thing. It’s not Christmas yet. Actually, it’s way too early.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The last thing was a packet of kitchen cloths with a heart pattern. They were my second choice. I don’t know… they were just really sweet, and I haven’t seen similar ones anywhere else. Usually, kitchen cloths are a bit of an ugly thing, but these were cute.</p>
