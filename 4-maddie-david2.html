        <p class="textindent2"><span class="timestamp">[00:07:16]</span> Really?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent"><span class="timestamp">[00:07:18]</span> Yeah, a little micro synth.</p>

      <div id="talk-one">
        <p class="notextindent">I just picked it up, and I thought, I bet you it doesn’t go. But I took it home, took the back of it, and looked at it. The batteries were all rusted and leaking, but I took them out and cleaned it up. I had a nine-volt plug and just plugged it in. Switched it on. And the light came on! [Gasping :-o]. <span class="timestamp">[00:30:16]</span> I pressed a key, and it went: diing [sound emoji] and it continued di-du-du-di-do, this real build up, spacy-astro-ish. OH MY GOD <3</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2"><span class="timestamp">[00:00:39]</span> As it warmed up?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent"><span class="timestamp">[00:00:41]</span> No, that was the sound that it was set to. Di-du-du-di-du-du-do. And then, I just got into my house with this amazing synth, and then suddenly; massive rain! So, if I hadn’t got it, it would have been destroyed.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2"><span class="timestamp">[01:14:42]</span> Wow, that’s pretty sweet. That’s a good find!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Yeah right. And I saw them online; they cost 300 dollars – because they were made in the 80’s. Those first kinds of portable synthesisers.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">So what do you think is the story behind that? Someone just cracked it when the batteries didn’t work? <span class="timestamp">[00:01:35]</span></p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Yeah, I think - because the batteries had destroyed the contacts inside, so it procurable just got left in somebody’s house like that. And then they didn’t have a plug, so they never tried to see if it worked.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2"><span class="timestamp">[00:01:58]</span> Are you sure they didn’t think: I’ll just put this here while just doing something else quick? :-D</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">I did, I did kind of think that for a little bit. But it was outside a church on our street where people just dump all their shit, because there used to be a second-hand store there. There is not anymore, but people still dump stuff there. <span class="timestamp">[00:02:18]</span> And there is even a sign: Please don’t leave anything here.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="talk-one">
        <p class="textindent2">But people throw out some ridiculous things. Like my object; one of my good mates and I were walking down the street, and a woman comes out of a house with two golf bags. And she is a little: arrh, annoyed, you know... <span class="timestamp">[00:02:39]</span> My friend is like: "Excuse me, is this what I think it is?" She’s like: "Yeah, take them, I don’t care." All flustered. I think they were about to go through a divorce...</p>

        </div>

        <div id="talk-one">
        <p class="textindent2"><span class="timestamp">[00:03:07]</span> She just put them on the street like hard rubbish. And they were quite a good set of golf clubs.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">That is cool. Properly worth hundreds of dollars? <span class="timestamp">[00:03:16]</span></p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Yeah, they were. Expensive! <br> But I asked if he was not going to come back and want them. She just said: "Take them! I don’t want to see any of his stuff!" And we just left with these two golf bags.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">That’s nuts. It is crazy when stuff like that happens. On the inside you’re thinking; what an idiot throwing this away, but on the outside, you’re like; ohh yeah, this is just trash……Let me just dispose of that for you.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Yeah, she just wanted them out, haha. <span class="timestamp">[00:04:12]</span></p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">And then when he came home: [With funny voice] "JANICE!! Where are my golf clubs????" :-D</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Haha; "Outside with the rest of your stuff!"</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">"On the footpath!"</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">"Why are the locks changed?"…</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">"Ask your secretary!"</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent"><span class="timestamp">[00:04:37]</span> Far out. But honestly, I love when there is hard rubbish. That’s my dream. You have to go to a rich suburb though; then you can get some amazing stuff! People don’t even understand.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2"><span class="timestamp">[00:05:54]</span> Yeah, I used to work for a council around Toorak, mowing lawns, and I used to find so many barbecues. Really, really, really good barbecues. Kitchen basically, that people just threw out. Just update them and buy another one. I saw people who would drive around in white trucks and just pick up all the stuff.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">You could start a gum-tree business literally from picking up rich peoples trash :—D</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2"><span class="timestamp">[00:05:39]</span> I suppose it’s like recycling. Repurposing. Like the keyboard, someone thought, this is just a shitty old keyboard, but then to you’re like: Hang on a minute!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Yeah, I clearly remember when I saw it, and was like :—O and thought; Is that what I think it is? I didn’t want to build up expectation, maybe it’d be broken, but I picked it up, and it was perfect.</p>
