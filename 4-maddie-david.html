But I took it home, took the back of it, and looked at it. The batteries were all rusted and leaking, but I took them out and cleaned it up. I had a nine-volt plug and just plugged it in. Switched it on. And the light came on! [gasping]. </p>

            <p>Yeah right. And I saw them online; they cost 300 dollars – because they were made in the 80’s. Those first kinds of portable synthesisers.</p>

            <p>So what do you think is the story behind that? Someone just cracked it when the batteries didn’t work? <span class="timestamp">[00:01:35]</span></p>

      <div class="row">
          <div id="left">
            <p>Yeah, I think - because the batteries had destroyed the contacts inside, so it probably just got left in somebody’s house like that. And then they didn’t have a plug, so they never tried to see if it worked.</p>

            <p>I did! I did kind of think that for a little bit. But it was outside a church on our street, where people just dump all their shit, because there used to be a second-hand store there. There is not anymore, but people still dump stuff there. <span class="timestamp">[00:02:18]</span> And there is even a sign: Please don’t leave anything here.</p>

            <p>But people throw out some ridiculous things. Like my found object; one of my good mates and I were walking along, and a woman comes out of a house with two golf bags. And she is a little: arrh, annoyed, you know... <span class="timestamp">[00:02:39]</span> And he is like: Excuse me, is this what I think it is? She’s like: Yeah, take them, I don’t care.

            <br>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[00:03:07]</span> She just put them on the street like hard rubbish. And they were a quite good set of golf clubs.</p>
