          <p>These are a bit safer. Padding In the knees and things like that. The Kevlar jeans are real baggy. Like thick. They're uncomfortable to wear; they got a short crotch area, where as these are really long, and they sit up above your hips. <span class="timestamp">[00:05:09]</span> So they're really comfortable to wear on a long ride.</p>

          <p><span class="timestamp">[00:48:59]</span> Yes, so they come right up and you can tug all your shirts and stuff in. Then you're actually not getting no wind in, where with the Kevlar jeans.. they're comfortable for an hour and then they're annoying, and feel funny to wear because of the Kevlar lining. It's actually really hot in the Kevlar jeans.</p>

            <p><span class="timestamp">[00:11:38]</span> I think‚Ä¶ uhm, why do I? It has this sort of beautiful sadness about it, a lot of the soundtrack is quite sort of bubbly and happy but then there‚Äôs bits that are like really morose and really sad. Like, you can sort of picture yourself looking out the window when it‚Äôs grey and raining.</p>
