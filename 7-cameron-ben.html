        <p>So <em>this</em> is what I bought. It’s a chicken. It’s carved out of a bit of  light timber, and been painted, and maybe varnished.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="talk-one">
        <p class="notextindent">It’s smooth to touch, and it’s really really light. Lighter than you’d think it would be. I bought it because it caught my <span class="emoji">👁</span> straight away. It’s sort of something I’d happily put on my shelf and it’d fit right in I think.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Why do you think it caught your eye?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">It’s made out of wood for a start, it has got good colours I think; like the dark colours of the body and sort of light colour of the wing. I don’t know, it’s just a interesting little ting.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Yeah, and it has a bit of.. character?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Yeah. A lot of character I’d say. I properly sat on a shelf somewhere.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Why do you think someone decided that they were done with it?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Do you reckon <em>that</em> moment when they had to make that decision of handing it over to the op shop or to keep i – do you think that was a tough one? Maybe not.. But I think there would have been a moment of hesitation. But I guess, some people have just too much stuff. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Yeah. Maybe they moved.. Or someone died <span class="emoji">💀</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Possibly..</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Did you notice the lady at the counter? She was like: "Oh" when she saw it, and she took it up and had a look at it. "You found that?". She seemed impressed. What do you think it is? It has that..</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">She properly looked at it several times, maybe it never really jumped out, but now she realised; "Oh no, it’s leaving the shop".</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2"><span class="emoji">😁</span> "I missed my chance". Do you think you’re gonna keep it?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">I’d keep it. It’d be fun to take to someones house, and just leave it in their hallway, put it on one of their shelfs.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Do you have someones house in mind, where it would sort of blend in?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Maybe my parents cottage. It’d be interesting to go back there in five years time; Oh, they still got that chicken. My dad would just assume my mom bought it, and she’d think he might bought it. So it might never have been questioned. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Yeah, like a happy-prank!</p>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div id="talk-one">
        <p class="textindent2">…</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">I bought this.. what do you even call this?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">A banana holder?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Banana shell? …Carrier?</p>

      </div>

      <div id="talk-one">
        <p class="notextindent">Banana lunch box?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Oh yeah, that’s a good one.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Or banana protector… I don’t even know if a banana needs that much protection to be honest.. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">That’s why I bought it. I think it’s pretty silly. When do you ever get a banana thats so perfect, that it fits into that? The idealistic banana, and other bananas get sad when they can’t fit into that size. Or even worse, if the supermarket wont buy funny shaped bananas.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Do you reckon people take it to work.. and.. use it?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Yeah, I guess so. A banana transporter.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Imagine if you bought two, because you got two bananas.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2"><span class="emoji">😁</span> Does it smell?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Nah, I don’t think it has had many bananas in it.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Yeah, I think it’s ridiculous. Maybe a good example of how stupid thing can go. Or maybe someone uses it every morning thinking: Wow, what a great invention.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">It’s just a wack thing to think up..</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">It makes me think of all the things the supermarket throws out because they do not meet the size or shape requirements. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="notextindent">Well, I’m pretty sure, that if apples are not perfect they get to go to the apple juice place. Maybe the bananas go to the banana bread place.. <span class="emoji">🍎</span></p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">Yeah, or banana ice-cream. Or the imperfect vegetable shop.. I think there is only one good thing about it, and that is that the op shop made 1 dollar. And when I return it, they can, <em>maybe</em>, make one more.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textindent2">One other good think about it is opening and closing it. It’s kind of nice. Maybe it can second as a meditative device. Like a pen you click. Then you can open and close your banana transporter.</p>
