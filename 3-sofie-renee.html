        <h3>Sofie</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I choose an octopus coathook, the size of the palm of my hand, sort of. Maybe a bit smaller. Itâ€™s slightly heavy, made of some kind of.. iron.. Itâ€™s a beautiful sky-blue colour. It has two hooks, sort of two octopus arms, and two crooked eyes.</p>
        <br>
        <!-- <img src="assets/images/renee-sofie_03.jpg" alt=""> -->
        <img src="assets/images/Sofie_0.06.jpg" alt="">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I choose this because Iâ€™ve just moved apartments, and I could use a coathook. Then I saw it, and I thought it was both cute and also a little special. Not just a hook for a jumper, but itâ€™s got something extra by being kind of quirky.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And it was so cheap too! Iâ€™ve seen a few designer homewares with similar octopus-hooks. But this one is a pretty good alternative.</p>
        <br>
        <p>[RenÃ©e] Itâ€™s funny because the eyes are crooked, and not like the ones where the screws sit parallel. Itâ€™s a bit cross-eyedâ€¦ or a little confused.</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Sofie] Yes, actually really <em>octopus-like</em>. Thatâ€™s pretty cool I think.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Things I considered:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I also had a look at some strawberry-flavoured straws, which were pretty cool. Quite unique. Theyâ€™d be spot on for a pink birthday party! <span class="emoji">ðŸ’˜</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>[RenÃ©e] Like a theme party?</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Sofie] Yes! I love them.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Then I considered some clear bags, like ziplock ones. They are just so versatile and can be used for heaps of things. Maybe more practical than strawberry-flavoured strawsâ€¦ Theyâ€™re great when travelling too â€“ for lotions and such.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I also saw a really pretty mortar and pestle. And itâ€™s because I think that a mortar is such a lovely kitchen thing, but then, at the same time, one that you never use. But it looks great, and if someone has one in their kitchen, then I always get the impression that they cook great food, haha.</p>
        <br>
        <p>[RenÃ©e] So youâ€™d like to give that impression, haha?</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Sofie] Yes, Iâ€™d love that <span class="emoji">ðŸ¤£</span></p></p>

        <p>The object I choose is a hair piece. Itâ€™s brown.. [guided by Sofie] a sort of amber-brown. It has a spring to make it open and grab your hair, a hair clip I guess. Itâ€™s made of plastic, and is, maybe, a little smaller than a palm. It has six 'teeth' that sort of clutched a piece of cardboard as itâ€™s packagingâ€¦ if you can call it thatâ€¦</p>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/images/Renee_0.01_brown.jpg" alt="">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I think the reason that I choose this is that itâ€™s something I can use every day. And I also thought, that maybe, it sort of matches my hair colour. Itâ€™s slightly lighter, but I can picture it. It has a bit of sheen and a few different shades somehow.</p>
        <br>
        <p>[Sofie] Itâ€™s also a bit fashionable at the moment to use a hair clip?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yes, youâ€™re right. This one is really cheap though, compared to those popular $20 ones! Yeah, so I think itâ€™s really cheap for an object, that I <em>know</em> I will use. Itâ€™s cheapness almost makes it more special. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Iâ€™m really happy with my hair clip.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Things I considered:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>A beer pong set â€“ because everyone knows that <em>that</em> is important to have <span class="emoji">ðŸ˜‰</span> But then I thought that I might not use it much. Maybe it's something youâ€™d buy when you need it. But I do like beer, and Iâ€™m actually pretty good at beer pong, so I thought it was an OK option.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then I had a look at some marzipan candy â€“Â which I love. But I wasnâ€™t really in a candy-mood, maybe they are also more of a Christmas-thing. Itâ€™s not Christmas yet. Actually, itâ€™s way too early.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The last thing was a packet of kitchen cloths with a heart pattern. They were my second choice. I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ they were just really sweet, and I havenâ€™t seen similar ones anywhere else. Usually, kitchen cloths are a bit of an ugly thing, but these were cute.</p>
