            <p>It is not the ute, its the boat. I got a phone call one day, it’s from my brother – this is at work. He is a very excitable fella, he is always trying to chase a buck, but he doesn’t have many bucks to start with. So he rings me up and he says: “RIGHT, I’ve got this really good deal, I just found this boat for sale, this guy wants to sell it. It’s like, six thousand dollars.” I say; “I don’t, I don’t have six thousand dollars!” “…but it’s worth about 15!” And he goes; “I’ll ring you back”, and hung up. About 10 minutes later I’m sort of sweating, thinking oh what’s he doing?</p>
            <br>
            <p>He rings me back, and he says: “He’ll take four thousand eight hundred, you gotta buy it!!”. And I’m like; “mate, I’m not a boat owner, I’m not a boat buyer, I don’t know anything about boats, I don’t even have a boat licence”. He’s like; “BUT THIS IS GOING TO MAKE YOU MONEY <span class="emoji">💰</span>”, and.. this happened in the space of 10 minutes.. and I go: “I’ll think about it”. So I put the phone down, and sort of thought for a second, I pick the phone back up and said; “I’ve just transferred you four thousand eight hundred dollars” and [laughing] he goes “all right, it’s done”. So over the space of about.. what would it be.. eight minutes, 10 minutes, I was the proud owner of the Hustler! Which is, I think it’s a 5,7 meter long speedboat <span class="emoji">😅</span> …But, it is not very characteristic of me to buy a boat. I’m not a boat man. But there it is, isn’t she beautiful. I actually went out on it, on Friday. And it didn’t sink. </p>

            <p><span class="timestamp"></span>I don’t.. like I said, I’m not a.. it’s good fun being on a boat, but it’s not.. it’s just expensive. You’ve gotta insure it, register it, toe it around, store it. Well, it lives at his house, so he is eventually gonna ask for some money for it, to hold it. So.. yeah, I actually tonight – because the trailer is broken– offered a guy 800 bucks to swop the trailer over.. so I’m waiting for that phone call. So, I’m kinda sitting on the edge of a money pit about to fall in.. We’ll see how I go.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The story was, that the guy who had it; it had a different motor on the back, the motor was a lot bigger. And he bought a brand new boat, that had this motor on. So, he bought this boat, for that motor. And then this just sat in his backyard. His partner, apparently, has been telling him for weeks; you need to get rid of the boat. This is a Thursday, and she said; “If you don’t get rid of the boat, we’re getting a divorce” <span class="emoji">☠️</span>..</p>

            <p>So, <em>my object</em>.. I was going to this party with a bunch of musician friends. <span class="timestamp">[00:36:52]</span> At the time, I was like a lot younger maybe 22 or 23, and I was hanging out with this group of people that thought they were the 'prodigal son type musicians', you know. So whenever I used to go there, I was not allowed to play their instruments. And so, we're walking to the party, and I didn't even really want to go, you know. Then we walked past the music store and I, like, I only had 50 bucks, and I was like; <em>okay</em>, I'm going to buy an instrument, and take <em>my own</em> instrument. So.. this is what I ended up buying [rattling sound <span class="emoji">🎵</span>] as Leah pulls up a bright, red tambourine from her backpack]. And I just really rocked the party. <span class="timestamp">[00:37:42]</span></p>

            <br>
            <p>It seems like it's easier to play, but it's not that easy. But it was funny when I went into the music store because I literally only had 50 bucks and I also wanted to buy, you know, the 1,5 litres of goon. So I need to buy that – it’s properly 10 bucks. So I need a budget, yeah, alcohol and the instrument's worth. So I went in there. Tried out a few things like the glockenspiel, that kind of thing, but that's 60 bucks–can’t afford that. And then, this; the sunlight was shining through the window, and I saw it sparkling, and I was like; WHAT is that!? I went over there and [abrupt tambourine-<span class="emoji">🎵</span>] hit it like that. I was like, shit yeah, I'm going to get that. It was 35 buck, so I was like Yeah! I can get a snack; I can get my goon. So I got it, and I went to the party, and everyone was like; Oh can I play with that? And I was like; naah, you can't. You can't. No. It's mine. <span class="timestamp">[00:39:02]</span> And I literally held it for the whole night.</p>

So I just keep rewriting things and re-recording things, and I guess, as time goes by it gets better as well. Sort of like if you're doing a painting and you started out not knowing how to paint really. And then you start in one corner and went around; it looks quite different. You'll develop your technique.</p>

          <p><span class="timestamp">[00:52:29]</span> Like. I hope so. I'm at a point now where I like have, sort of embraced the music industry and female community in New Zealand a bit more. It has given me more space to move a bit. I've grown up with lots of dude musicians but not really known that many other women. It's been kind of sexist sometimes. It's also when you're in that space with drunk dudes; they feel like they can just grope you, it's not really like you want to be there, you know. <span class="timestamp">[00:53:14]</span> It's like they either want to fuck you or they don't fuck with you at all. I've kind of moved away a lot from that. And yeah, see what happens.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div id="left">
          <p><span class="timestamp">[00:53:40]</span> There are lots of venues here. Lots of venues, I think it's the most live venues of any city in the world, in Melbourne. It's sort of more diverse, and they have more structure of things where they're trying to support women and you know, to have more opportunities. Especially in the indie music scene, I think there is stronger community and more space for female musicians, whereas in New Zealand it's kind of a bit bro-culture kind of shit you know. But I think it's getting better because there's been a lot of really amazing female musicians coming out. So.. I'm forever hopeful. <span class="timestamp">[00:54:58]</span> I did this Girls Rock thing, which is like mentoring 12–18–years–old in music. In a week they write a song, and then perform that original song at the end of the week. And even seeing that. They don't have the same conditions that I had to put up with when I was their age, which means that they don't hold the same insecurities, which I think is pretty cool.</p>

          <p><span class="timestamp">[00:56:24]</span> Yeah! Just being in that space with young people who don't have the same preconceptions about things, that's really quite transformative. That makes you change as well, because you get kind of stuck in this idea of the way that things are but when they're so optimistic, and they don't have that weight, you're like, oh maybe it's possible.</p>
