        <br>
        <p>So, <em>my object</em>.. I was going to this party with a bunch of musicians friends. <span class="timestamp">[00:36:52]</span> At the time, I was like a lot younger maybe 22 or 23, and I was hanging out with this group of people that thought they were the 'prodigal son type musicians', you know. So whenever I used to go there, I was not allowed to play their instruments, and so, we're walking to the party, and I didn't even really want to go, you know. Then we walked past the music store and I, like, I only had had 50 bucks, and I was like; <em>okay</em>, I'm going to buy an instrument, and take <em>my own</em> instrument. So.. this is what I ended up buying [ratteling sound <span class="emoji">üéµ</span>] as Leah pulls up a bright, red tambourine from her backpack]. And I just really rocked the party. <span class="timestamp">[00:37:42] </span><span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump1">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/images/Leah_Phil05b.jpg">
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:37:45]</span> Yeah, with the tambourine.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It seems like it's easier to play, but it's not that easy. But it was funny when I went into the music store because I literally only had 50 bucks and I also wanted to buy, you know, the 1,5 litres of goon. So I need to buy that ‚Äì it‚Äôs properly 10 bucks. So I need a budget, yeah, alcohol and the instrument's worth. So I went in there. Tried out a few things like the glockenspiel, that kind of thing, but that's 60 bucks‚Äìcan‚Äôt afford that. And then, this; the sunlight was shining through the window, and I saw it sparkling, and I was like; WHAT is that!? I went over there and [abrupt tambourine-<span class="emoji">üéµ</span>] hit it like that. I was like, shit yeah, I'm going to get that. It was 35 buck, so I was like Yeah! I can get a snack; I can get my goon. So I got it, and I went to the party, and everyone was like; Oh can I play with that? And I was like; naah, you can't. You can't. No. It's mine. <span class="timestamp">[00:39:02]</span> And I literally held it for the whole night.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:39:05]</span> Do you know scrumpy hands? <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump2">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <!-- <img src="assets/images/Leah-Phil-scrumpy_hands.jpg" alt=""> -->
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:39:15]</span> Yeah, so to one hand I taped the goon, and I taped the tambourine to the other hand. <span class="timestamp">[00:39:20]</span> And I had that on all night.</p>
        <!-- <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump3">‚òû</a></span> -->
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:39:26]</span> Yeah because eventually you really need to go to the toilet. And it's difficult. Especially when you got a tambourine. But it was good. Like it was the first time with that group of people there. I kind of felt like I had power. And even when people got drunk, and you hear them talking pretentious shit, I just [making rattle <span class="emoji">üéµ</span> with tambourine]. <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump4">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:40:21]</span> Yeah, there are heaps of things you can do.. tap this part, make a bit of music [plays music <span class="emoji">üéµ</span>]. <span class="timestamp">[00:40:34]</span> Now I've had eight or so years to develop my tambourine skills. This one doesn't get as much play anymore. I play other instruments too. But I always got the memory of it <em>calling me with sunshine</em> <span class="emoji">‚òÄÔ∏è</span> and being in my budget. I think the key thing was being in the budget, the goon budget. You know. <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump5">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:41:13]</span> Yeah, and I had like an actual artefact to show:</p>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/images/Leah_Phil13b.jpg" alt="">
        <!-- <br>
        <p><span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump6">‚òû</a></span></p> -->
        <br>
        <p>‚Ä¶</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:41:43]</span> Yeah, it's more like music you write for a drummer. You know it's more like rhythm than actually notes. <span class="timestamp">[00:42:07]</span> Yeah, you can definitely do that. <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump8">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:44:13]</span> There is no quiet. I feel like it's sort of symbolic of the right now; I'm just going to be noisy. <span class="timestamp">[00:44:29]</span> And there's no subtle way to come in with a tambourine either. It's on, or it's off. It's not like guitar where you can just slowly kind of.. <span class="timestamp">[00:44:50]</span> Ohh, the tambourine is coming in.</p>
        <!-- <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump9">‚òû</a></span> -->
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:44:54]</span> Yeah, <em>raw</em>, that's exactly what I'd describe it as.<span class="timestamp">[00:45:15]</span> When I first started playing gigs live and stuff I used to play just with an acoustic guitar and this, and just put it on the ground, and tap my foot on it. It's where it all started, hehe. <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump10">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:45:37]</span> Yeah. I've played gigs here [Melbourne] too, but not very recently.</p>
        <!-- <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump11">‚òû</a></span> -->
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:45:41]</span> Yeah. From New Zealand. From Dunedin. Music City, hehe.</p>
        <!-- <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump12">‚òû</a></span> -->
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:46:01]</span> Yeah, I do. My last gig was kind of horrendous. The sound guy didn't know what the hell he was doing. It's a really small room, that had a lot of acoustic sounds, you know, and it was really loud, and I keep getting feedback on the monitor as well. Pretty bad. <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump13">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <p>‚Ä¶</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:48:13]</span> Yeah it's usually only cool because you're with all your mates, everyone's on the same drunk level. Yeah, when you go in there during the day it's usually just that one dude who goes there every single day. <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump14">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:48:41]</span> Yes, maybe he's playing hoping to win the big one. Kind of like investing in a boat, <em>haha</em>.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:48:59]</span> You've got to be in it to win it. <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump15">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <p>‚Ä¶</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:50:34]</span> I was in a band for a little while, but that fell through. You really got to be with the right people.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:50:50]</span> I think it's more, you know, there are some people who just want to be in a band because they think it's cool, but they're not actually that into music. They just want to smoke drugs and drink alcohol. You know. I'm not saying I don't want to do those things, but you want to play music. <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump17">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:51:13]</span> I've been recording an EP for like four years or something like that. So I just keep rewriting things and re-recording things, and I guess, as time goes by it gets better as well. Sort of like if you're doing a painting and you started out not knowing how to paint really. And then you start in one corner and went around; it looks quite different. You'll develop your technique. <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump18">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:52:04]</span> Yeah, I could also write a theme song for your boat; [sings] Hustler [tambourine rattle <span class="emoji">üéµ</span>]. <span class="pointer"><a href="#ljump19">‚òû</a></span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:52:29]</span> Like. I hope so. I'm at a point now where I like have, sort of embraced the music industry and female community in New Zealand a bit more. It has given me more space to move a bit. I've grown up with lots of dude musicians but not really known that many other women. It's been kind of sexist sometimes. It's also when you're in that space with drunk dudes; they feel like they can just grope you, it's not really like you want to be there, you know. <span class="timestamp">[00:53:14]</span> It's like they either want to fuck you or they don't fuck with you at all. I've kind of moved away a lot from that. And yeah, see what happens.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:53:40]</span> There are lots of venues here. Lots of venues, I think it's the most live venues of any city in the world, in Melbourne. It's sort of more diverse, and they have more structure of things where they're trying to support women and you know, to have more opportunities. Especially in the indie music scene, I think there is stronger community and more space for female musicians, whereas in New Zealand it's kind of a bit bro-culture kind of shit you know. But I think it's getting better because there's been a lot of really amazing female musicians coming out. So.. I'm forever hopeful. <span class="timestamp">[00:54:58]</span> I did this Girls Rock thing, which is like mentoring 12‚Äì18‚Äìyears‚Äìold in music. In a week they write a song, and then perform that original song at the end of the week. And even seeing that. They don't have the same conditions that I had to put up with when I was their age, which means that they don't hold the same insecurities, which I think is pretty cool.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:56:24]</span> Yeah! Just being in that space with young people who don't have the same preconceptions about things, that's really quite transformative. That makes you change as well, because you get kind of stuck in this idea of the way that things are but when they're so optimistic, and they don't have that weight, you're like, oh maybe it's possible.</p>
        <br>
        <p>‚Ä¶</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[01:02:08]</span> I guess.. I just had to go for it [the tambourine].</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[01:02:17]</span> It's cool to have. Almost like a memento of my music journey as well.</p>

        <br>
        <p><a id="ljump5"><span class="timestamp">[00:40:59]</span></a> That's impressive. Even with budget for having a couple of cheeseburgers on your way home. <span class="timestamp">[00:41:10]</span> That's a good night.</p>

        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:41:24]</span> It's cool. I always wanted to know. When you see music, and there's a tambourine player, can you actually write music for a tambourine?</p>

        <p><a id="ljump8"><span class="timestamp">[00:44:08]</a></span> A tambourine.. there really is no quiet way of walking around with it. It's always rattling.</p>
