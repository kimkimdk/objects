        <p>So, <em>my object</em>.. I was going to this party with a bunch of musicians friends. <span class="timestamp">[00:36:52]</span> At the time, I was like a lot younger maybe 22 or 23, and I was hanging out with this group of people that thought they were the 'prodigal son type musicians', you know. So whenever I used to go there, I was not allowed to play their instruments, and so, we're walking to the party, and I didn't even really want to go, you know. Then we walked past the music store and I, like, I only had had 50 bucks, and I was like; <em>okay</em>, I'm going to buy an instrument, and take <em>my own</em> instrument. So.. this is what I ended up buying [ratteling sound ðŸŽµ as Leah pulls up a bright red tambourine from her backpack]. And I just really rocked the party. <span class="timestamp">[00:37:42]</span></p>

        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:37:45]</span> Yeah, with the tambourine.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It seems like it's easier to play, but it's not that easy. But it was funny when I went into the music store because I literally only had 50 bucks and I also wanted to buy, you know, the 1,5 litres of goon. So I need to buy that â€“ itâ€™s properly 10 bucks. So I need a budget, yeah, alcohol and the instrument's worth. So I went in there. Tried out a few things like the glockenspiel, that kind of thing, but that's 60 bucksâ€“canâ€™t afford that. And then, this; the sunlight was shining through the window, and I saw it sparkling, and I was like; WHAT is that!? I went over there and [rattling sound] hit it like that. I was like, shit yeah, I'm going to get that. It was 35 buck, so I was like Yeah! I can get a snack; I can get my goon. So I got it, and I went to the party, and everyone was like; Oh can I play with that? And I was like; naah, you can't. You can't. No. It's mine. And I literally held it for the whole night.</p>

        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:39:05]</span> Do you know scrumpy hands?</p>
        <!-- <img src="assets/images/Leah-Phil-scrumpy_hands.jpg" alt=""> -->
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:39:15]</span> Yeah, so to one hand I taped the goon, and I taped the tambourine to the other hand. <span class="timestamp">[00:39:20]</span> And I had that on all night.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="timestamp">[00:39:26]</span> Yeah because eventually you really need to go to the toilet. And it's difficult. Especially when you got a tambourine. But it was good. Like it was the first time with that group of people there. I kind of felt like I had power. And even when people got drunk, and you hear them talking pretentious shit, I just [making noise <i class="em em-musical_note"></i> with tambourine].</p>
