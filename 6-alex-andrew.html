        <p class="orange">Alex and Andrewâ€™s task was to choose an object from their partnerâ€™s belongings, that they appreciate.</p>

        <p>The object I choose of Andyâ€™s was his bike. <span class="emoji">ðŸš´</span> This is a good one; him and his dad [showing photo above]. Your dad got you into bike riding? Yeah, they do that together.</p>

        <br>
        <p>CX stands for â€˜cyclocrossâ€™, it means, yeah, you can ride it on road or offroad essentially.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There were a few bikes of Andyâ€™s to choose from, but I think this is his favourite one â€“ itâ€™s definitely more adventurous... Family adventures. We do stuff <em>together</em>. We were going out on the bikes today, but it rained. Soon <span class="emoji">ðŸ˜ƒ</span></p>

        <p>So I guess I chose this objectâ€¦ becauseâ€¦ well one reason is that I bought it for you. I chose it for you because I thought it was cool. Itâ€™s a very practical item â€“ a little bag in the front of your bike so you can store your little bits and pieces in there. Like your little glovies. And your keys. Itâ€™s from a Melbourne based.. bag-maker, I guess. He makes adventure gearing, now he calls himself Overland Gear Australia. I wanted one, but instead of buying one for me, I bought one for you. Itâ€™s been stuck on the front of your bike.. since you got it, pretty much. So you seem to like it.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Yeah, I think it looks cool. I think itâ€™s called a â€˜burrito bagâ€™.. so your nickname was burrito-Pete for a time there. So, a little â€“ a little <em>burrito</em> <span class="emoji"></span>ðŸŒ¯ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

        <img src="assets/images/andrew-5.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>The inside is nice and orange, which matches your bike as it turns out. But it also makes it a lot easier to find things inside the bag. So it was well thought out.</p>
