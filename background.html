        <h3  id="empathy">Empathy</h3>
        <br>
        <p> In the Oxford Dictionary app on my Mac I searched for "empathy" and was instantly provided the following description:</p>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/images/empathy_screen_shot.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>I believe most of us consider ourselves emphatic beings, and mostly think of sociopaths in the lack thereof. Pondering over the concept, I attempted to think of when I last had a feeling of being emphatic. It can easily be confused with similar notions such as friendliness, sympathy, happiness and more. While I will not set out on a journey to distinguish them or to form <em>one</em> truth, I suggest the thought for you to think about. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Searching for a memory of an empathic moment, one was hard to pick out. Was it, for example, when I saw someone run to catch the tram only to just miss it – and <em>feeling that</em>? Or observing a mother with a newborn on her chest, endlessly yawning at the local cafe – and <em>feeling her</em>? I guess, and hope, that we all experience empathy in all sort of ways, in small moments and larger. But I did also think to myself, that often the feeling occurs in moments or stories of e.g. joy or sadness – "enlarged" emotional moments – and maybe less so in monotonous, everyday life. </p>

        <h3 id="agent">Object agency</h3>
        <br>
        <p> Objects can take many shapes and go by many names. Thing. Artefact. Article. Item. Piece. They are all around us. Often we got too many, seldom too few.</p>
        <p> Inherent in a object-based enquiry exists a conundrum of objects as symbol of mass-consumption and consumerism, while also posing the option for objects as being meaningful. While both can be true, this project adapts a more positive note of objects as important and meaningful in our understanding of the world.</p>
        <p>The things with which we live are not only a medium through which to think the world, but also form an integral part of living and acting and doing in that world. From a consistently Marxist and materialist perspective, things are part and parcel of society, culture, politics and values, and constitute a key medium through which we can understand and analyse social identity, change and transformation. (Tilley 2011, p. 350)</p>

        <h3 id="umbrella">Workshops</h3>
        <br>
        <p>From an empirical vantage point, I intend to substantiate this research with quantitative inquiry using methodologies of social research and theoretical reflection. Preliminary, semi-structured interviews with expert practitioners will inform and help shape object-based inquires, and also provide insight into current design practices and tools of participatory design. Building on interview discoveries and examples, I will investigate objects as mediator of empathic one-on-one encounters through a series of workshops — akin to object-based social experiments of small-scale.</p>

        <h3 id="metaphor">The emotional metaphor</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In Bruno Latour’s From Realpolitik to Dingpolitik Or How to Make Things Public he states: “For too long, objects have been wrongly portrayed as matter-of-fact. This is unfair to them, unfair to science, unfair to objectivity, unfair to experience.” <span class="timestamp">(p.158)</span>. Alfred Gell <span class="timestamp">(1998)</span> likewise argues that objects take effect not exclusively by communicating conventionally understood messages but suggests a ‘grey area where semiotics inference merges with hypothetical inferences of a non-semiotic kind’ <span class="timestamp">(p.14)</span>. Gell phrases this notion abductions – ‘neither ‘semiotic conventions’ or ‘laws of nature’ but something in between’ <span class="timestamp">(p. 15)</span>. As such, one may contend objects as commonly understood, neither as systems or semiotics but rather open up for the non-iconic discourse that a chair is more than a device with which to sit.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lusebrink seems to similarly address Gell’s ‘grey area’ where objects exist as tools for meaning-making. Lusebrink speaks of visual symbols and metaphors’s ability to give meaning and form to language, feelings or energy in the subconscious; as a mediator between ‘the body and psyche’ <span class="timestamp">(2012, p. 49)</span>, concurring with the notion that richness of emotion is often conceptualised and understood using metaphors and metonymies <span class="timestamp">(Abbott & Forceville 2011; Feng & O’halloran 2012; Lusebrink 2012; Kövecses 1990)</span>, and to help build a system of thinking and concepts that can guide in confusion and aid in making ‘something unfamiliar familiar’ <span class="timestamp">(Moeschberger & DeZalia 2014, p. 6)</span>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Christopher Tilley likewise suggests the metaphor as central to both material culture and language as a means of linkage ‘between seemingly disparate social and material domains’ <span class="timestamp">(2006, p. 62)</span>.</p>
        <p>One may argue that visual objects can extend beyond their design intent and physicality, and give meaning and form to language, concurring with Tilley on the non-verbal materiality of objects, and how “material forms complement what can be communicated in language” <span class="timestamp">(2006, p. 62)</span>.</p>
