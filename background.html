        <p>As a minute response under the larger umbrella of design as a social and political force, this research sets out explore the phenomena of objects (artefacts) as social agents for interconnection, adopting the possibility of object agency as a tool to design for opportunity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We all take our steps in an increasingly rapid and unpredictable world. Unrest in politics, environment and social structures call for all of us to cope with and respond to increasing complexity and a need for empathy and understanding.</p>

        <p>From an empirical vantage point, I intend to substantiate this research with quantitative inquiry using methodologies of social research and theoretical reflection. Preliminary, semi-structured interviews with expert practitioners will inform and help shape object-based inquires, and also provide insight into current design practices and tools of participatory design. Building on interview discoveries and examples, I will investigate objects as mediator of empathic one-on-one encounters through a series of workshops — akin to object-based social experiments of small-scale.</p>
