        <p id="empathy"> In the Oxford Dictionary app on my Mac I searched for "empathy" and was instantly provided the following description:</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>I believe most of us consider ourselves emphatic beings, and mostly think of sociopaths in the lack thereof. Pondering over the concept, I attempted to think of when I last had a feeling of being emphatic. It can easily be confused with similar notions such as friendliness, sympathy, happiness and more. While I will not set out on a journey to distinguish them or to form <em>one</em> truth, I suggest the thought for you to think about. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Searching for a memory of an empathic moment, one was hard to pick out. Was it, for example, when I saw someone run to catch the tram only to just miss it – and <em>feeling that</em>? Or observing a mother with a newborn on her chest, endlessly yawning at the local cafe – and <em>feeling her</em>? I guess, and hope, that we all experience empathy in all sort of ways, in small moments and larger. But I did also think to myself, that often the feeling occurs in moments or stories of e.g. joy or sadness – "enlarged" emotional moments – and maybe less so in monotonous, everyday life. </p>

        <p id> As a minute response under the larger umbrella of design as a social and political force, this research sets out explore the phenomena of objects (artefacts) as social agents for interconnection, adopting the possibility of object agency as a tool to design for opportunity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We all take our steps in an increasingly rapid and unpredictable world. Unrest in politics, environment and social structures call for all of us to cope with and respond to increasing complexity and a need for empathy and understanding.</p>

        <p>From an empirical vantage point, I intend to substantiate this research with quantitative inquiry using methodologies of social research and theoretical reflection. Preliminary, semi-structured interviews with expert practitioners will inform and help shape object-based inquires, and also provide insight into current design practices and tools of participatory design. Building on interview discoveries and examples, I will investigate objects as mediator of empathic one-on-one encounters through a series of workshops — akin to object-based social experiments of small-scale.</p>
